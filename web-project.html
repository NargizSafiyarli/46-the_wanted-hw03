            <h2>How Websites Work?</h2>
            <p>Our team, "The Wanted," consists of dedicated members who worked collaboratively on various aspects of
                the project including our team leader Nargiz Safiyarli, Bahman Sariyev and Rafael Heybatzada.Nargiz was
                responsible for developing and designing the Home page (index.html), the "Our Team" page
                (team-members.html), and the "Coding Event" page (hour-of-code.html). She utilized HTML and CSS to
                create the navigation bar, structure the pages, and design layouts. Additionally, she developed
                interactive elements for the website using JavaScript (script.js).Bahman focused on developing and
                designing the "Project Details" page (website-project.html) and the "Code Artist" page
                (code-artist.html). He implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create designs and integrate code art
                examples with a minimalist approach.Rafael played a key role in the creative and content development
                aspects. He came up with the team name, "The Wanted," and designed the team logo. He wrote all the
                textual content for the website, including sections about the team, team members, and the "Hour of Code"
                event. Additionally, Rafael was responsible for writing the project report.</p>
